We are excited to announce that this year's Keystone DH will be held in Philadelphia at CHF. Now in its third year, Keystone DH is an annual conference and a network of institutions and practitioners committed to advancing collaborative scholarship in digital humanities research and pedagogy across the Mid-Atlantic. Recognizing how DH scholarship in practice necessarily bridges conventional academic distinctions, we invite contributions from across the field, including faculty researchers and unaffiliated scholars, librarians and technologists, artists and critical-makers, research institutions and other organizations.
