## THE CAREWORK AND CODEWORK OF THE DIGITAL HUMANITIES

<img src="../media/Lauren_Klein_small.jpg">

Professor Lauren Klein will explore how carework and codework resonate in a digital humanities context. Carework often refers to the subset of feminized reproductive labor undertaken out of a sense of compassion or responsibility for others, rather than with a goal of monetary gain. While codework, according to Alan Sondheim, is characterized by “the computer stirring into the text, and the text stirring the computer.” Thinking about digital tools in terms of codework, we can more fully account for the carework involved in their creation, as well as in the creation of the archives that, in designing our tools, we seek to more fully understand.
